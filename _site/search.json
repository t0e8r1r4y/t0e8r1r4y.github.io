      "content"  : "1. 드루이드 개발 목적\n\n\n1-1.드루이드란? ( 논문의 결론 부분 )\n\n드루이는 다음을 충족하는 데이터 스토어이다.\n\n\n  분산\n  컬럼 지향형\n  리얼타임 분석 데이터 스토어 (처리하는 데이터를 drill-down하게 aggregates 할 수 있도록 설계 됨)\n  고성능, 쿼리 지연이 낮도록 설계 됨.\n  스트리밍 데이터 처리와 fault-tolerant를 지원함.\n\n\n\n\n1-2. 드루이드 개발 목적 ( 논문의 도입 부분과 문제 정의 부분 )\n\nDruid was originally designed to solve problems around ingesting and exploring large quantities of transactional events (log data). → OLAP\n\n드루이드는 분산,  컬럼 지향형, 리얼타임 분석 데이터 스토어 ( 쿼리 수행 속도가 더 빠른 )를 개발하고자 만들었다.\n\n이는 기존의 하둡이 혁신적이고 데이터 저장과 대용량의 데이터에 대한 접근은 우수하지만, 데이터에 대한 접근 속도(실시간 쿼리 등), 병렬로 수많은 데이터가 쏟아지는 경우 드루이드 개발자들의 니즈에 충족되지 못하였다고 함. ( Hadoop wasn’t going to meet our needs ).\n\n그리고 NoSql 아키텍처나 다른 솔루션들도 개발진이 원하는 수준이 아니거나, 비용타당성이 떨어짐.\n\n\n\n이러한 메타데이터는 Timestamp가 있고, Dimension 컬럼이 많고, Metric 컬럼이 많다.\n\n\n  원문  \n  This metadata is comprised of 3 distinct components. First, there is a timestamp column indicating when the edit\n  was made. Next, there are a set dimension columns indicating various attributes about the edit such as the page that was edited, the\n  user who made the edit, and the location of the user. Finally, there\n  are a set of metric columns that contain values (usually numeric)\n  that can be aggregated, such as the number of characters added or\n  removed in an edit.\n\n\n드루이드 개발진은 이러한 데이터를 drill-down하게 계산하고, aggregates 하는 것을 목표로 하였다. 그래서 논문의 결론을 한번더 언급하지만\n\n\n  분산\n  컬럼 지향적\n  리얼타임 데이터 분석 ( 리얼타임으로 drill-down하게 계산하고, 집계(agrregates) 하는 데이터 스토어\n\n\n이런 것을 만들고자 Druid를 만들었다.\n\n\n\n\n2. 드루이드 아키텍처\n\n\n\n2-1. Real-time Nodes\n\nReal-time Nodes는 실시간 데이터를 흡수하는 계층이면서 스트림에 쿼리 이벤트를 수행하는 노드라고 보임. ( 흡수하는 계층이면서 데이터 컨슈머 역할을 함 )\n\nReal-time Nodes에서는 이벤트들을 흡수하고 실시간 쿼리가 가능한데, 이를 위해서 in-memory index 버퍼를 유지함. ( 그리고 이를 위해서 JVM 내부 힙 기반의 버퍼를 사용한 row store를 가지고 있다고 하는데 요대목이 조금 이해가 안됨 )\n\n그리고 유지하는 index는 주기적으로 디스크에 유지하여 불변성을 유지함. 그리고 요때 컬럼지향형으로 데이터가 converting 된다.\n\n디스크에 저장된 index는 불변이고, 이를 논문에서는 persisted-indexer라고 명명함. 그리고 disk에 저장된 index들을 Off-heap memory에 불러온다.\n\n논문에서 제시한 도식처럼\n\n쿼리가 Real-time Node에 들어오면( Events indexed via these nodes are immediately available for querying ) in-memory index와 Off-heap memory and persisted indexex 둘 다 searching 해서 결과를 return한다.\n\n\n\n그리고 Real-time nodes는 일정 기간동안 영구적으로 저장된 index들을 하나의 불변의 block으로 묶고 ( 이를 segment라고 명명함 ) 영구적인 백업스토리지에 업로드를 한다.\n\n이런 백업 스토리지는 S3나 HDFS와 같은 파일시스템을 주로 쓰게되며, 이러한 행위를 드루이드에서는 deep storage라고 한다.\n\n이 과정을 요약하자면\n\n\n  실시간 스트리밍 데이터를 흡수하여 in-memory-index를 생성\n  in-memory-index를 컬럼 지향형 포맷으로 converting하고 Disk에 저장\n  일정 기간(some span of time) 모인 데이터를 묶어서 segment 생성\n  이 세그먼트를 백업 스토리지 저장 → deep store\n\n\n이 과정을 다시 논문 도식에 추가해보면…\n\n\n\n(데이터 indexing 방법에 대한 일반적인 내용도 조금 참고가 필요함)\n\n검색 데이터 색인 방법론\n\n\n\n2-1-1. Availability and Scalability\n\n위에서 Real-time-node는 컨슈머라는 표현을 썻는데… 논문의 맥락상 그 이야기는 여기 나온다. 컨슈머는 별도의 데이터 스트림을 생성해 줄 프로듀서가 필요하다.\n\n주로 이럴 때 kafka를 쓴다. 데이터 버스 역할로 카프카를 쓰는 이유는 데이터 버퍼의 역할과 데이터 손실 났을 때 카프카 broker에 저장 된 데이터 소스에서 데이터를 가져다 쓰기 때문에 손쉬운 복구가 가능하다는 의미로 보인다.\n\n\n\n논문에서 제시하는 카프카 + 드루이드 조합의 성능은 원문 그대로를 가지고 왔다\n\n🔥 원문 - In practice, this model has allowed one of the largest production Druid clusters to be able to consume raw data at approximately 500 MB/s (150,000 events/s or 2 TB hour).\n\n\n2-2. Historical Nodes\n\nHistorical Nodes는 불변 데이터의 읽기 일관성을 제공하는 노드다.\n\n\n\n해당 노드는 Deep Storage로 부터 세그먼트를 다운로드하거나 메모리로 로드하는 역할을 한다. Real-time-nodes 설명에서 동작하는 과정에서 위의 역할을 해주는 것이 historical nodes다.\n\n\n\n2-2-1. Tiers\n\nTiers는 Historical nodes의 그룹으로 정의한다. 티어들은 각각의 티어단위로 설정되는데,\n\nDifferent performance and fault-tolerance parameters can be set for each tier\n\n라고 원문에서 밝힌다. ( 원문을 한글로 더 좋게 번역을 못하겠음 )\n\n이렇게 하는 목적은 중요도에 따른 세그먼트들의 높고 낮은 우선순위 때문이다. 논문에서는 예시를 들어서 설명했는데, 액세스가 더 많이 되는 세그먼트들에게 더 큰 캐쉬 메모리를 할당하기 위한 목적 정도로 간단히 이해하면 될 듯.\n\n\n\n2-2-2. Availability\n\nHistorical node는 주키퍼를 통해 세그먼트를 로드 하거나 언로드하는 명령을 받는다. 그래서 주키퍼가 unavailable 상태가 되면 더 이상 새로운 세그먼트는 받지 못함. 그러나 서빙은 가능함.\n\nThis means that Zookeeper outages do not impact current data availability on historical nodes.\n\n\n\n2-3. Broker Nodes\n\nBroker Nodes는 real-time nodes와 historical nodes 사이에서 ‘쿼리 라우터’ 역할을 한다. 두가지 nodes 노드에게 질의하여 결과를 merge하는 역할을 하고 있다.\n\n\n\n2-3-1. Caching\n\n브로커 노드는 LRU 캐시 전략을 사용한다. ( 캐시 전략은 별도 링크 )\n\n\n\n\n  Broker nodes는 쿼리를 받으면 일단 세그먼트 셋에서 먼저 일치하는 것이 있는지 확인\n  일치하는 것이 있다면 다시 계산할 필요 없음\n  일치하는 것이 없다면, broker nodes는 historical nodes와 real time nodes에  쿼리를 각각 날림\n  broker nodes는 historical nodes에서 온 결과 값이 있으면 이를 cache로 저장 ( 이렇게 하는 이유는 real time nodes는 perpetually changing and caching the results is unreliable 하기 때문.\n\n\n\n\n2-3-2. Availability\n\n상태를 관리하는 주키퍼가 unavailable하게 되어도 쿼리가 가능하다. 기존에 클러스터와 통신이 정상이라고 하면 쿼리 수행을 하기 때문.\n\n\n\n2-4. Coordinator Nodes\n\nCoordinaotr Nodes는 드루이드 아키텍처 내부에서 ZooKeeper와 같은 역할을 하는 nodes이다. Historical nodes들의 분산 코디네이터 역할을 하며, historical nodes와 주키퍼 사이에서  load new data, drop outdated data, replicate data, and move data to load balance 이런 명령을 전달하는 역할을 한다.\n\nCoordinator Nodes들은 주키퍼에 의해 메인이 선출되고 나머지는 backup의 형태로 동작함\n\nCoordinator Nodes들은 주기적으로 현재 클러스터들의 상태를 결정한다. MySql에는 클러스터들의 내부 파라미터, config 정보가 있다. 이런 정보를 바탕으로 예상되는 클러스터의 상태와 실제 상태를 비교하여 상태를 결정한다.\n\n상태를 결정하면 MySql db에 저장된 rule table에 기반하여 세그먼트와 클러스터를 관리하게 된다.\n\n\n\n2-4-1. Rules\n\nrules은 historical segment들이 로드되고 드랍되어야 하는지에대한 것이며 다음과 같이 정의 된다.\n\n\n  Segment들이 어떻게 각기 다른 historical tier에 할당이 되어야 하는가\n  Segment들이 어떻게 replication 되어야 하는가\n  언제 Segment가 drop 되어야 하는가. 주로 시간으로 한다고 함\n\n\n그리고 이러한 rule은 MySQL db에 저장하고 load해서 사용함. 모든 Segment들에 매칭되는 Rule에 대해 적용한다.\n\n\n\n2-4-2.  Load Balancing\n\nproduction 환경에서는, historical nodes는 제한적인 리소스를 가지고 있기 때문에, segment들은 반드시 클러스터들에게 골고루 배분되어야 한다.\n\n이를 위해서 Druid는 a cost-based optimization procedure that takes into account the segment data source, recency,\nand size 를 사용한다고 한다.\n\n( 세부 알고리즘에 대한 설명은 없는데, 위 설명을 보자면 일반적으로 쿼리 패턴은 최근의 세그먼트를 자주 참조하는 경향이 있기 때문에, 최근 참조를 많이하는 segment는 복제를 더하는게 좋다고 논문에는 되어 있는데 맥락이 조금 이해가 안됨. )\n\n\n\n2-4-3. Replication\n\ncoordinator nodes는 historical nodes에게 같은 segment를 복제하라고 할 수 있다. 복제하는 숫자는 설정을 통해 계산이 가능하다.\n\n높은 레벨의 fault tolerance를 위해서는 많은 수의 레플리카를 설정하면 된다고 하면서, 사례를 논문에서는 제시함.\n\n\n\n2-4-4. Availability\n\ncoordinator nodes는 주키퍼와 MySql을 외부 의존성으로 가진다.\n\n\n  주키퍼 : historical nodes에 대한 클러스터 상태\n  MySql : Operation에 필요한 management information\n\n\n주키퍼가 unavailable 되면 현재 클러스터간 통신 상태 유지 ( 위 다른 nodes 와 동일 )\n\nMySql이 unavailable 되면 새로운 segment의 생성, 및 drop 불가능.\n\n\n\n\n3. Storage Format\n\n드루이드의 데이터 테이블은 시계열 이벤트이며 파티셔닝 된 segment들의 집합임.\n\n\n🔥 segment에 대한 정의는 아래 원문을 가져왔다.\n\nwe define a segment as a collection of rows of data that span some period of time.\nSegments represent the fundamental storage unit in Druid and replication and distribution are done at a segment level.\n\n\n\n드루이드의 데이터 포맷에서는 timestamp 컬럼이 반드시 있어야 된다. (논문에서는 always requires 라고 표현 함 ) 그 이유인 즉슨, 시간의 세분성을 기준으로 데이터의 볼륨과 시간의 범위를 결정하기 때문이다.\n\nSegment들은 데이터 소스의 식별자 역할을 한다. 새로운 segment가 추가 됨에 따라 time-interval, version이 증가되어 이 정보를 바탕으로 segment들의 최신버전???(freshness)를 반영함.\n\nDruid의 Segment는 컬럼 지향형이다. 그래서 aggregate에 best used 되어 있다. row 지향형보다 집계를 함에 있어 column 지향은 해당 컬럼만 로드하면 되기 때문에 더 효율적이다.\n\nDruid는 다중 컬럼 타입이 있고, 이는 다양한 데이터를 나타낸다고 함. 이러한 컬럼 타입에 의존하여 디스크에 데이터를 스토리징하는 비용이 줄어든다고 함.\n\n\n🔥 위 내용에 대한 예시와 ‘Indicaes for Filtering Data’ 그리고 ‘Storage Engine’에 대한 부분은 이해가 부족하여 차후 정리. OS 관련 지식이 조금 요구되는 부분.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Query API\n\n\n  \n    {\n      \"queryType\" : \"timeseries\",\n      \"dataSource\" : \"wikipedia\",\n      \"intervals\" : \"2013-01-01/2013-01-08\",\n      \"filter\" : {\n      \"type\" : \"selector\",\n      \"dimension\" : \"page\",\n      \"value\" : \"Ke$ha\"\n    },\n      \"granularity\" : \"day\",\n      \"aggregations\" : [{\"type\":\"count\", \"name\":\"rows\"}]\n    }\n  \n\n\n위에서 설명한 각각의 노드들은 RestFul API가 존재하며, POST 메서드 형식에 body에 위와 같은 JSON 형태가 들어간다.\n\n그리고 드루이드는 조인 쿼리를 제공하지 않는다 .( A join query for Druid is not yet implemented )\n\n이는 컬럼 지향형 데이터 구조에서 Aggregation에 최적화 된 드루이드에서는 아래 두가지 이유로 조인을 제공하지 않는다.\n\n\n  Scaling join queries has been, in our professional experience,\na constant bottleneck of working with distributed databases.\n  The incremental gains in functionality are perceived to be\nof less value than the anticipated problems with managing\nhighly concurrent, join-heavy workloads.\n\n\n조인에 대해서 여러가지 전략이 있겠지만, Druid에서는 여러가지를 조인하는 것이 복잡한 메모리 관리가 필요한 큰 테이블이 요구되어, 메모리 관리의 복잡성이 증폭된다고 한다.\n\n🔥 결론 ! 조인을 제공하지 않는다.\n\n\n해당 부분은 아래 Druid 쿼리 관련한 내용을 함께 보면 좋을 듯.\n\nSQL · Apache Druid\n\n\n\n논문의 다음 내용은 성능과 Production Level에서의 드루이두 사용 결과에 대한 내용이다.\n\n일단 druid에 대한 주요 내용은 위 내용이 중요하다고 판단되어 우선 정리하였고, 빠진 개념들을 해당 글에 계속 보강하고자 함."

      "url"      : "/serial-communication",
      "content"  : "PART ONE: HAVING FAITH IN GRAND DREAMS. Understanding the why of the work is the most important thing that’s needed when starting out. It’s so easy to become discouraged when you’re in the the thick of the weeds, when you need to do difficult or tedious. Motivation and discipline to do such work comes from having a bigger picture — a purpose.\n\nThis purpose comes from a place of realistic optimism and idealism. It’s a messy and bold goal. A tangible, yet implausible objective without conventional measure or perspective. There’s a lot wrong with the world — and a lot of people that will complain about it — but how can you improve it? What troubles are you willing to tackle head-on for the good of humanity?\n\n\n\n Person Making Clay Pot | Source\n\nHow to effectively go about doing what’s truly important.\n\n\n\nIt’s a lot to ask, to a point where most people don’t even push themselves to even attempt it. And those that do attempt to achieve something grand usually stop after failing only once or twice.\n\nThe reason so few people succeed in capturing the essence of a heartfelt purpose is a lack of faith. Having the faith in yourself that you’re truly capable of accomplishing that goal, no matter the obstacles, or opinions, or failures that you will inevitably face. It takes a fair amount of foolishness to ever succeed in accomplishing audacious.\n\nDon’t back out of a goal as soon as it looks like it’s going to fail — have more trust than doubt. Many people discuss the learning opportunities that reside in failure, but the truth of the matter is that gritting your teeth and persevering and eventually finding success is a far more enriching learning experience.\n\nIt is important to understand the context of where you currently stand in history. Research your contemporaries that have similar goals — especially if they’re currently doing far better than you are. Research the great thinkers and creators of the past, as well. Having this contextual model will not lead you to achievement, but will guide you in the right direction, like a compass.\n\nAt the same time, you must not be rigid with your objectives, either. Do not let pride get in your way — redirect your efforts if you need too. Being agile is far more intelligent than abandoning your efforts altogether and starting from square one.\n\nPART TWO: ELIMINATING EVERYTHING NON-ESSENTIAL. Simply understanding what you want to accomplish will not allow you to actually get it done. The what of work is doing the technical and nitty-gritty, which is the contrary of the initial motivating and lofty goals.\n\nThey both outstandingly require one another. Being only an idealist thinker won’t get anything done. While being only a busy-bee worker won’t get anything meaningful done.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you are clueless when you’re first beginning — that’s normal. Mastery of any knowledge or skill requires only deliberate practice and enough time. Be humble enough to absorb the knowledge of everybody around you. Learn to constantly ask critical questions. Be resourceful with the amount of information you can find both locally and online.\n\nFigure out priorities, examine what work needs to be done as opposed to what’s just easy and non-essential filler. The next part is vital: look at your schedule and block out large chunks of time (four to seven hours) where you just work on what’s most important.\n\nYou cannot allow yourself to be interrupted by others, or distract yourself with the plethora of attention-grabbing media that’s currently at our disposal. This can be extremely difficult at first, but don’t be afraid to communicate with others that you’re busy with something and that you’ll talk to them later.\n\nSimilarly, push yourself to sticking to one tab or application open at a time. Stop yourself from constantly jump from one inquiry to another. Be mindful of how you’re using technology — take a break every once in awhile.\n\nA lot of people say they simply don’t have the time in their schedules to devote themselves so deeply to something. But the truth of the matter is that even if you have other responsibilities, you can fit this work into your calendar by understanding and eliminating the time you’re currently wasting — because we all waste time.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI believe we’re all given the opportunity to achieve goodness in the world that’s beyond ourselves — whether it’s in small ways or big ways. We’re all born being good at something — technical or creative — and with an intense curiosity of the world we live in.\n\nIt is far too easy to veer off the path of pioneering, to instead be comfortable with letting life pass us by. I believe that we can make the conscious decision to change that — at any point in our lives — and instead aspire to greatness. All it takes is a little courage, and a lot of reckless abandon."

      "content"  : "Alright, let’s get into the weeds this week (or perhaps flowers?). Overall, I think I’ve found a good equilibrium with Beeminder. I don’t often derail, but at the same time I have over a dozen beemergencies every single day.\n\nI’m also really happy for the spread of systems I have, finding ways to track my mental health, physical health, hobbies, and both creative and technical projects.\n\nRegarding French, I’ve been stuck in the Emerald league forever in /duolingo, but progressing down the tree nonetheless. /clozemaster is definitely a welcomed addition, as the lessons are a lot quicker and give a more nuanced look at how words are actually used.\n\nSince I began tracking /writing in May, I’ve written over 100,000 words, which is crazy to me. Although a good portion is just private journal writing, I’m still happy I’m doing it everyday. Before, I’d really try to win NaNoWriMo every year (anybody participating, btw?) and always fall short because I never wrote &gt;1,500 words a day otherwise. I suppose I’d rather write ~400 words a day indefinitely than risk pushing and burning myself out.\n\nI’m still finding a bug (or maybe feature) where /meditation doesn’t add data if you’re repeating a guided meditation. I’ve switched over to doing simple timed meditation with Insight Timer and that seems to work instead!\n\nI recently derailed on /fitness by just a couple hundred steps, which initially seemed silly. But in reality, I have to remind myself that whatever I’m tracking on Beeminder is the bare-minimum threshold, and I gotta pass it everyday no matter what.\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed that I talked about on the Beeminder Discord (which you should join!) is that all my systems ultimately fall within two categories: input-based vs. output-based.\n\nNow, when I originally began with Beeminder many years ago, I had the rhetoric that you should aim for looking at input rather that output. Which I still believe is better–but why not both if that’s an option?\n\nThere are a few examples of this: /writing is the input, and other goals like /blogging or /poetry are output. (A caveat being that writing is fortunately easy to both quantify and automate.)\n\nOutput-based goals that I’ve been having the most trouble with are the ones that I haven’t really found a good input-based supplementary goal to add to it. I do really well with beemergencys pushing me towards doing work, but output goals don’t have a daily metric, they’re usually weekly or monthly.\n\nI finally had the brilliant idea to use RescueTime and track the amount of time that I’m specifically on Lynda each day to supplement /courses. I had a few good ideas for tracking pages read or time with /books, but I often get weasel-y if the data isn’t automated. 😅 So it’d be nice to figure out a way to connect with Kindle or Audible.\n\n(P.S. Working on a new Jekyll theme this week, Purelog!)\n\n(P.S.S. Anybody doing NaNoWriMo this year? Using Beeminder to track it?)"

      "content"  : "Quite a red-letter day for my neighbours south of the border. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t anxious for tonight, so I better finish this weekly review as early as possible :^)\n\nFirst off, my apologies for this post not being very Beeminder-specific, I’ve been getting dedicated with my development work with Jekyll the past week. So I haven’t really given the time needed to examine how my Beeminder goals have been affecting things in my life, like I usually (neurotically) do. I’m planning to do a full review of my now 24(!) systems.\n\nSome bad news and good news: The bad news is that I definitely bit off more than I can chew with trying to modify Simply Jekyll. It already had a 1,300 line CSS file, and I decided it would be a good idea to add Bootstrap on top of that, and although I love how it looks and what it’s capable of, it’s hopelessly bloated.\n\nThe good news is that I successfully completed Hacktoberfest for the first time! But even better, I went back to the drawing board and created my first open-source project for others: Watery, which is the most minimal yet functional Jekyll theme I could create. I went down the rabbit hole of classless CSS frameworks and used the most popular one, Water.css, for this.\n\nI also just added a neat feature on the demo site that lets you effortlessly see how it would look using a different classless CSS framework instead, which really demonstrates its extensibility.\n\nTo tie it back to relevancy, I am probably going to use a variant of this theme for my Beeminder blog journal.bar. Speaking of, I’ve been thinking more down-the-line about this experiment, and trying to figure out if there would be any meaningful way to measure difference from the beginning to, say, a year after. I can offer my own layman’s observations, but it’d be neat to be an academic guinea pig."

On the forums, I was given the Regular badge, meaning I can change thread titles, such as “Brennan’s Beeminder Journal 2020” to “Brennan’s Beeminder Journal”, which allows this Beejournal to continue ad infinitum, huzzah!\n\nRegarding /morning-pages, the solution I found was to use URLminder, this will track the word count of (multiple) Google Docs or Dropbox documents. I figure I’ll add a new document each month, as I find that’s a good time-frame to segment writing. And unlike Draft, URLminder lets you change the deadline time, which was my entire problem in the first place. The caveat being that I’ll need to adjust to writing somewhere else consistently.\n\nThis week’s verbal contract will be: To get a better at understanding API. Although I’ve found multiple new systems within the unofficial integration lists that I’m excited to use, it made me realize how much more potential there is–and perhaps the frustration that 3rd party solutions seem so ephemeral. Khan Academy, for instance, have deprecated their API entirely. FreeCodeCamp hasn’t had theirs updated in nearly two years. Is interest in this kind of things just too niche?\n\nOn the other hand, I think there’s benefit in there only being thirty or so high-quality official integrations. I know when I first was starting out, I didn’t feel overwhelmed by the paradox of choice.\n\nNew Systems\n\nAs I’ve written about a few weeks ago, limitation breeds creativity for me. It’s been fun trying to work with just the official integrations, but this would not be an experiment of self-improvement if stagnation was allowed! Exciting things are going on, I’m trying a bunch of new stuff.\n\n\n  /ClozeMaster: Supplement my French learning with Duolingo\n  /Meditation: It’s so cool how you can use Apple Health to track mindful minutes with different meditation apps. I’m still have to figure out my favorite but right now I’m using Headspace.\n  /Prayer: Using Rosarium (Beeminder’s blog post about it), my relationship with spirituality is complicated, but I definitely enjoy the Rosary prayer, and it’s a good way to start my days with the right intentions.\n\n\nP.S. I figured out why RescueTime was still measuring time even though I was AFK. It has to do with a pesky design flaw (more detail) of the ThinkPad W520 (which, by the way, is the best laptop ever minus this one thing).\n\nP.S.S. Also added a link to @narthur’s beewiki to journal.bar, I hope it catches on! 😊"

I’m really enjoying becoming increasingly focused on both the weeds of technicalities, as well as trying to think deeper on the higher concepts that I’m trying to utilize.\n\nFor starters, I’ve written in the past about wanting to pivot, but I realize that I am perfectly capable of adding work rather than changing what this project is.\n\nI’ve also written about wanting to give myself more self-permission. Essentially, I want a place that’s truly mine where I can place my thoughts exhaustively. Not just polished, finished work such as my blog or portfolio. I’m writing roughly 400 words a day anyways, it might as well be for a utilitarian purpose and public.\n\nAs much as I enjoy the concept of digital gardens as an ideal, I do have some problems with the specifics (also seen with Roam Research). It sort of reminds me of the Dvorak keyboard layout–far more practical and productive, but alas I’m am already far too entrenched in both QWERTY and traditional, hierarchical note-taking.\n\nI also don’t want a specific program for private use, such as Notion. Rather, I found a wonderful Jekyll theme that incorporates a lot of the concepts that I am drawn towards: Backlinks, wiki-style links, context menu, page preview, margininlia, etc. You can see these being utilized here, it’s really cool.\n\nTo relate it back to Beeminder, in addition to collecting my notes, I want this to be a place for daily entries, that include getting more in-depth with my /gratitude journal, and /foodlog, for starters–and having the project be on GitHub means I can simply create a new system with GitMinder that only tracks that repository.\n\nAnyways, much more related to Beeminder, I’ve been having trouble with URLminder. Currently, /morningpages2 is kind of just stuck at around 4,300 words for some reason–maybe I just input the Google Doc link incorrectly. I also had to sadly archive /typing, since I couldn’t get my TypeRacer games to sync, but that was a just-for-fun goal anyways.\n\nP.S. Trying to get into APIs last week ended up snowballing into a new project of it’s own: SelfTeach.Academy. I don’t think there’d be enough interest to try to make this a reality, though."

I’ve noticed the iOS application updated though, so maybe it was just an anomaly.\n\nAlso, I think the reason things were weird with URLminder reading from Google Docs was simply because I didn’t set the privacy settings for the document correctly, whoops. Seems to be working now! I know it’s been forever since I initially started with this goal–and I haven’t really needed it since I’ve started a devlog on Draft that I plan to migrate–but I think it’s still worth finally implementing correctly.\n\nI’ve been fumbling hard with /distraction lately. I’ve been derailing due to incorrect labeling of different websites I’ve been visiting, and it doesn’t update like other systems do, to the point where it’s 11:50 and it’s still orange because it hasn’t updated (and I know I shouldn’t be in front of a screen that late, but that’s another issue that needs to be tackled), which is a problem since it’s a do-less goal.\n\nThe simple solution to this is to just visit the RescueTime dashboard one per evening to make sure that the obscure sites I’m visiting are correctly labelled and that I’m not going over my unproductive screen-time limit."

I also changed the rules on RescueTime to be more strict with what’s considered distracting so I waste less time on the computer.\n  In general, I changed the views of a few older goals that I created back in 2017 to see their full range, rather than just when I restarted them.

Similarly, I’ve made data points public where applicable.\n  I also still need to find a new solution to /morning-pages, and this is my verbal contract to myself I’ll have that corrected before next week’s post.\n\n\nI finally took a gander at beemind.me for new ideas, and I’ll be going over the integrations megalist (now that I know it exists, hah) this week to see what else I can add.\n\nMy rule of thumb for new systems is this, I’ll add it to my already large list of beemindings if I find a way to:\n\n\n  Automatically track what I already to.\n  Automatically track something I really want to start doing.\n  Automatically track something that’s fun and takes less than five minutes (see /typing).\n  Or, manually tracking something I need to start doing.\n\n\nNew Systems\n\n\n  /meta: I’ve been trying to figure out what my meta goal should be for awhile, and I think tracking the daily cumulative data points from my other systems fits. It’s definitely more interesting/fun than helpful right now, but why not?\n  /typing: I love typing games, and have been using KeyHero forever, so why not give TypeRacer a try!

However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930– 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia’s School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation’s most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (’ 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up….The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.  …As to what I might do for you— I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse’s pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works—quick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards…The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.  …Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning— a little paragraph each night, if you can’t hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower painting…And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., the leprechaun throw.  There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsay’s Congo. I congo on. I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of — the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance.

And to top it all, even the researches that focus on the legibility[[Bauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R. (1980). Improving the legibility of visual display units through contrast reversal. See Below for more.::rsn]] and aesthetics claim that dark on light is almost always better than dark on light. Every article I have read and referenced below vouch for dark on light, which I find to be true too at least in most occasions.How can what is relatively bad for legibility in most ocassions, bad in terms of expressibility of authorial aesthetics be a wide-spread preference? My hypothesis is this is primarily due to cognitive exhaustion like sleep deprivation, burn-out, stress etc (Extrapolating from n=1), which due to implicity conformity and [[preference falsification::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification]] has become a normative social element. My experience has been that when I have had a bad last night sleep or stress due to office, I invariably am looking for less polarity, otherwise the dark on white seems more appealing to me both aesthetics wise and legibility wise. An extension of these could be that cognitive stress elevate the ocular stress like accomodative/refractive/convergence stress leading up to this, but I contest dark mode being the wide-spread personal/subjective preference.ReferencesBauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R.

For example, Bauer and Cavonius (1980) found that participants were 26% more accurate in reading text when they read it with dark characters on a light background…”Pabini Gabriel-Petit. (2007). [[Applying color theory to digital displays::https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/01/applying-color-theory-to-digital-displays.php]]  “…While white text on a black background provides very high value contrast, it is less readable and causes greater eye fatigue than black text on a white background…”Jason Harrison – Post Doctoral Fellow, Imager Lab Manager – Sensory Perception and Interaction Research Group, University of British Columbia  People with astigmatism (approximately 50% of the population) find it harder to read white text on black than black text on white. Part of this has to do with light levels: with a bright display (white background) the iris closes a bit more, decreasing the effect of the “deformed” lens; with a dark display (black background) the iris opens to receive more light and the deformation of the lens creates a much fuzzier focus at the eye.Raluca Budiu.

However, the difference between light mode and dark mode in the visual-acuity task was smaller for older adults than for younger adults — meaning that, although light mode was better for older adults, too, they did not benefit from it as much as younger adults, at least in the visual-acuity task.  When researchers looked at fatigue metrics, they concluded that there was no significant difference of contrast polarity on any of them (meaning that it wasn’t the case that dark mode made people more tired, or vice versa)…”Lauren V.

      "content"  : "To improve as a programmer, every programmer whether working independently or in an organization should atleast have one project that they control 100% of, and it doesn’t matter if it is your main project or a side project. When you are working for an organization or working independently on a collaborative oss, the major chunk of your cognitive bandwidth gets allocated to those projects, which is not bad per-se, it does teach you how to work in a collaborative environment and to learn from people who are better at the concerned technology/concept than you. But the issue is more personal and emotional in when you are working on something bigger than you, it unwittingly causes a self-effacive effect i.e., you tend to devalue the emotional effects of being able to create something with complete autonomy, or crave for the autonomy and burnout as a result of the cognitive exhaustion. The sense of freedom and the liberating experience that comes out of the creative autonomy is just unmatched.Even a side-project in github that you consider to be trivial has an effect that only such kind of projects can provide, of having done everything yourself and without anyone putting constraints on what you can and what you can’t. It allows you to experiment outside of what would be acceptable within a project you are doing with others. Something like what if I just re-wrote this entire engine on top of openGL would never (or almost never) make sense in a collaborative project, but it would make perfect sense if it is just you.The other obvious advantage is it makes you much more light-hearted because you know that if this doesn’t work out the way I like it or good for me, then I can just go. When you are working on a personal project out of your own free will, it has a certain kind of air that a collaborative project won’t. It is purely voluntary, and you can just up and leave at any time. That adds something to the mix. The responsibility of joy or stress that comes out of it suddenly becomes more tolerable as well as enjoyable. Note that I am not advocating that you drop everything that you don’t like, it is just that having certain things in your life that you can control can help handle that which you can’t.Related: [[Creativity is a quality without a name]]ReferencesAndreas Kling.
